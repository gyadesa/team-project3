Addis Ababa Ethiopia light railway 
Group project -3

Addis Ababa Light Rail is a light rail transportation system in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia that started public service just recently. It is the first track electrified light rail and rapid transit in eastern and sub-saharan Africa.

Current Problem:
The current service is not efficient and since the Train schedules and time routes are manually posted on billboards, it is not convenient for users to know the following list of issues:
Where the closest station is ? 
Not able to know when the next train is scheduled to arrive?
When’s the last train? 
How much the fair cost to ride? Ect

Why?
To provide a better, efficient and convenient service to the public use. To digitalize the trains schedule and system as a free app on the handheld and desktop computers, so that the community, use to have an access the city on the Light Rail.
In order to provide newly opened urban metro service train with a better train schedule for people in Ethiopia.
In order to able to provide accurate departure time, destination and platform information to people.
To have updated information regularly with live information about the train schedule.
To able to select a particular station from multiple of routes with decorated colors.
Able to view and follow the train time arrival and delay on their hand held devices. 

Proposed Solution
The Addis Ababa Light Rail App offers a map-centric way to see the location, the closest station, when the next train is coming, full schedule, and answer quick questions like: “how much does it cost?”

How?  and Tools to use
We built the app in React Native, a great Facebook technology. React Native will bring us the capability of bridging our existing knowledge of React, a Javascript library, to make a legitimate, Native, mobile app. This was an exciting learning experience for Team project-3, since we’re web developers, we will become mobile developers as well.

What’s Left
Like any software project, we would like to use any tools that are beneficial to complete the project for a use. We are planning to get familiar with other tools, like Mapbox, Xcode, Cocoapods, CodePush, and Firebase Analytics. We used Trello, Slack, appear.in, Sketch, Invision, and GitHub to stay organized.


Process
Our process to build the app was iterative. We did research, drew concepts, and started development early. We talked in Slack. We had video chats in appear.in. We pushed code to GitHub.
